# GMPHD_MAF: Online Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation with GMPHD Filter and Mask based Affinity Fusion
This repository includes an implementation of the GMPHD_SAF tracker in C/C++ with a demo code and supplementary materials.

# Progress
Now we have been preparing a journal submission with more experiments.
We would expect that the first upload of the implementation codes will be done within a month. (end of Nov. ~ the first week of Dec. in 2020.)

# Paper 

The paper is available in two versions:
[[BMTT2020 website](https://motchallenge.net/workshops/bmtt2020/index.html)]
and
[[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00100)].

Arxiv version has been extended from the BMTT worshop version.

# Experimental Results

We participated "tracking only" track in 5th BMTT MOTChallenge Workshop: Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation in conjunction with CVPR 2020.
