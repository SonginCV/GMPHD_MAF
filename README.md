# GMPHD_SAF: Online Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation with GMPHD Filter and Simple Affinity Fusion
This repository includes an implementation of the GMPHD_SAF tracker in C/C++ with a demo code and supplementary materials.

# Progress
Now I have been preparing a journal submission with more experiments.
I would expect that the first upload of the implementation codes will be done within a month. (end of Nov. ~ the first week of Dec.)
